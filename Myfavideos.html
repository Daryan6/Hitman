  <h1>Hitman2 Agent 47</h1>
  <p>47 is a paid assassin (a hitman) clone.[1] He gets his name from being the forty-seventh clone created from the DNA of five different men. These clones were made to be perfect assassins who could easily maintain peak physicality and intelligence, while easily being controlled to whoever they were devoted to, a handler.[1] As 47, the player gets to travel the world and execute hits on individuals, while trying to be as stealthy as possible. This includes taking disguises, using aliases, and using silenced weaponry.</p>
